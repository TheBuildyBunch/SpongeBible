            This one looks like you vomited everywhere.
            <br>The walls are pink and blue, the ground is blue, and the other ground is pink, with a scooter welded to the bed.
            <br>This bathroom comes with a hideous washing board and a singular high heel.
            <br>The kitchen comes with fake grass to accompany the chicken-like countertops.
            <br>The living room is sunken in with sand and poles everywhere, so the fire department is corroded.
            <br>The bathroom walls are made of muscle, and the tub is made of eggshells.
            <br>This could be an escape room; when you shut the lights off, children will run amok.
