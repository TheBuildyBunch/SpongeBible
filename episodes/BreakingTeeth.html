            SquiggleWalk, holding the wheel, rolled everything. You will see a black person transitioning into SpongeBible's house. SpongeBible is sitting in the living room. He looks out the window, but no one is there. He leans back and looks at his photo and poor SquiggleWalk has no face. After this, she looked out the window again and wept.

            He jumps at Juice, but he puts his shirt back on and starts shooting him. SquiggleWalk rams the holy stars, arms wrapped around the pedestal as he steals excalibur. He pushed the rock, rolled down the hill, with the rock. When he reached the bottom with the rock, an atomic explosion erupted nearby, causing nuclear devastation unto the Bathing Bottoms.
